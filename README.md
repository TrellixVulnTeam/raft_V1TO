# RAFT - Restaurant Search Engine

RAFT (Randomly Assign/Find a Table) is a restaurant search engine built on the Python Django web framework, intended to simplify the process of searching for new restaurants and exploring different cuisines. Utilizing the wonderful Yelp Fusion and Google Places APIs, RAFT provides relevant restaurant data based on a user's selected search terms and filters, including price, location, rating, cuisine, etc.

A RAFT iOS/Android application is currently in the works - I will update this README.md once they're avialable for download!

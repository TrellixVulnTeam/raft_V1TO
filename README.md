RAFT - Random Restaurant Generator

RAFT (Randomly Assign/Find a Table) is a random restaurant generator created using the Python Django web framework. 
The Yelp Fusion and Google Places API work in tandem to provide relevant restaurant data based on a user's selected filters, including price, location, rating, cuisine, etc.

I personally find it extremely difficult to choose new restaurants, so this eases the burden for myself and many like me.
